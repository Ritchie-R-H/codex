    """Initializes matrix with constant value according to `scale`.

    This initialization function was designed to avoid the early training stall due to too
    large or too small probability mass values computed with the initial parameters.

    Softplus is applied to the matrix during the forward pass, to ensure the matrix
    elements are all positive. With the current initialization, the matrix has constant
    values and after matrix-vector multiplication with the input, the output vector
    elements are constant::

        x / scale ** (1 / 1 + len(num_units))

    Assuming zero bias initialization and ignoring the factor residual paths, the CDF
    output of the entire distribution network is constant vector with value::

        sigmoid(x / scale)

    Therefore `scale` should be in the order of the expected magnitude of ``x``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape
        Two integers, the shape of the matrix.
    scale
        Scale factor for initial value.

    Returns
    -------
    Array
        The initial matrix value.

class DeepFactorizedEntropyModelBase(continuous.ContinuousEntropyModel):

    This is a flexible, nonparametric entropy model convolved with a unit-width uniform
    density. The model learns a factorized distribution. For example, if the input has 64
    channels (the last dimension size), then the distribution has the form::

       CDF(x) = \prod_{i=1}^64 CDF_i(x_i)

    where each function ``CDF_i`` is modeled by MLPs of different parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    This model is further described in appendix 6.1 of [1]_. Convolution with a unit-width
    uniform distribution is described in appendix 6.2, ibid. Please cite the paper if you
