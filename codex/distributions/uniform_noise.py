  uniform noise adapter distribution.
  Given a base `tfp.distributions.Distribution` object, this distribution
  models the base distribution after addition of independent uniform noise.
  Effectively, the base density function is convolved with a box kernel of width
  one. The resulting density can be efficiently evaluated via the relation:
  ```
  (p * u)(x) = c(x + .5) - c(x - .5)
  ```
  where `p` and `u` are the base density and the unit-width uniform density,
  respectively, and `c` is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
  corresponding to `p`. This is described in appendix 6.2 of the paper:
  > "Variational image compression with a scale hyperprior"<br />
  > J. Ball√©, D. Minnen, S. Singh, S. J. Hwang, N. Johnston<br />
  > https://openreview.net/forum?id=rkcQFMZRb
  For best numerical stability, the base `Distribution` should implement both
  `cdf()` and `survival_function()` and/or their `log_*` equivalents.
