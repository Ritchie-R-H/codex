# CoDeX

CoDeX contains learned data compression tools for JAX.

You can use this library to build your own ML models with end-to-end optimized
data compression built in. It's useful to find storage-efficient representations
of your data (images, features, examples, etc.) while only sacrificing a small
fraction of model performance.

For a more in-depth introduction from a classical data compression perspective,
consider our [paper on nonlinear transform
coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03034), or watch @jonycgn's [talk on learned
image compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_q7cZviXkY). For an
introduction to lossy data compression from a machine learning perspective, take
a look at @yiboyang's [review paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06533).

## Documentation & getting help

Please post all questions or comments on
[Discussions](https://github.com/google/codex/discussions). Only file
[Issues](https://github.com/google/codex/issues) for actual bugs or feature
requests. On Discussions, you may get a faster answer, and you help other people
find the question or answer more easily later.

## Installation

To install CoDeX via `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install jax-codex
```

To test that the installation works correctly, you can run the unit tests with:

```bash
python -m codex.all_tests
```

Once the command finishes, you should see a message ```OK (skipped=29)``` or
similar in the last line.

## Usage

We recommend importing the library from your Python code as follows:

```python
import codex as cdx
```
